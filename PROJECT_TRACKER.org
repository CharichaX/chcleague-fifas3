* Should I Focus only on clip features? (TitTok for gaming)??
Like posting a video would be to clip. For example, shroud clipped drdisrespected.
More importantly shroud owned drdisrespected
A platform for flexing of your gaming skills, to flex, to mock, etc.
- Clipping others will start certain public polling system where there will be positive & negative reactions.
- If the reaction is positive, the clipper (original poster) will get upvotes or certain flexable metrics to master, legendary, immortal ^^^.
- But if the reaction is negative, the clipper (original clipper) will get downvotes loses their ratings to something like noob, beginner, amatuer.
